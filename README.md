# Technology Used :
  `1. HTML `( For making the structure of the website) <br>
  `2. CSS `( For styling Html element for better Visual Appearance <br>
  `3. Node.js `( serves as the backend server responsible for handling client connections, managing chat rooms or channels, and facilitating communication between clients using websockets.) <br>
  `4. Socket.io ` (is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients over websockets. It provides a simple and reliable way to establish a persistent connection between the server and the client, allowing for instant data exchange. Socket.IO abstracts the underlying complexities of websockets, providing a seamless and cross-browser compatible solution for real-time communication.)
